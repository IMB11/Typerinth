## Installation

Simply execute the following command in your commandline:

```bash
npm install typerinth
```

## Usage

Import the package like this:

```ts
import { Modrinth } from 'typerinth';
const modrinth = new Modrinth();
```

### Options

You can change the options to tune typerinth to your liking:

```ts
import { Modrinth } from 'typerinth';
const modrinth = new Modrinth({
        baseUrl: "https://api.modrinth.com",
        apiVersion: "v2",
        userAgent: "AppName/Version",
        cache: {
            ttl: 600,
            checkperiod: 120,
            useCache: true
        }
    });
```

Once you have done this, you can use all the following functions as you like.

### Projects

#### Search

```ts
import { SearchIndex } from 'typerinth';
const result = await modrinth.search("life", {
    limit: 3,
    index: SearchIndex.Downloads,
})
```

You can use Facets to filter search results more precisely.

1. **Facet**: Represents a single filter condition. It consists of:
   - **FacetType**: The category of the filter (e.g., versions, categories, etc.).
   - **FacetOperation**: The comparison method (like EQUALS).
   - **Value**: The actual value to filter by.
2. **FacetGroup**: Combines multiple Facets with a logical **OR**. If any of the Facets in the group match, the result is included. A FacetGroup can also just have one Facet.
3. **SearchFacets**: Combines multiple FacetGroups with a logical **AND**. This means that all groups must match at least one Facet for a result to be included.

Hereâ€™s an example where we search for projects related to "life", filtering them to show only results that:
- Belong to the "forge" category **AND**
- Are compatible with Minecraft version "1.16.5" **OR** "1.20.1".

```ts
import { SearchIndex, SearchFacets, FacetGroup, Facet } from 'typerinth';
const result = await modrinth.search("life", {
    limit: 3,
    index: SearchIndex.Downloads,
    facets: new SearchFacets(
            new FacetGroup(
                new Facet(FacetType.Categories, FacetOperation.EQUALS, "forge")
            ),
            new FacetGroup(
                new Facet(FacetType.Versions, FacetOperation.EQUALS, "1.16.5"),
                new Facet(FacetType.Versions, FacetOperation.EQUALS, "1.17.1")
            ),
    )
})
```

#### Get a project by its ID or slug

```ts
const project = await modrinth.getProject("project-id");
```

#### Get multiple projects by their IDs or slugs

```ts
const projects = await modrinth.getProjects(["project-id-1", "project-id-2"]);
```

#### Get a random selection of projects

```ts
const projects = await modrinth.getRandomProjects(5);
```

#### Check if a project ID or slug is valid

```ts
const isValid = await modrinth.checkProjectValidity("project-id");
```

---

### Versions

#### Get the versions of a project

```ts
const versions = await modrinth.getProjectVersions("project-id", {
    loaders: ["forge"],
    gameVersions: ["1.16.5"]
});
```

#### Get a version by its ID

```ts
const version = await modrinth.getVersion("version-id");
```

#### Get multiple versions by their IDs

```ts
const versions = await modrinth.getVersions(["version-id-1", "version-id-2"]);
```

#### Get the version from a file hash

```ts
const version = await modrinth.getVersionFromFileHash("file-hash");
```

---

### Users

#### Get a user by their ID or username

```ts
const user = await modrinth.getUser("user-id");
```

#### Get multiple users by their IDs or usernames

```ts
const users = await modrinth.getUsers(["user-id-1", "user-id-2"]);
```

#### Get a user's projects

```ts
const projects = await modrinth.getUserProjects("user-id");
```

---

### Miscellanous

#### Get tags

Gets tags as described in the [Modrinth API documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/#tag/tags/operation/categoryList).

```ts
import {TagType} from "typerinth";
const tags = await modrinth.getTag(TagType.Loader);
```

#### Get a License by its ID

```ts
const license = await modrinth.getLicense("license-id");
```

const stats = await modrinth.getStatistics();
```
